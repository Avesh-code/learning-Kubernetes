# Kubernetes Documentation  
## 1. Introduction To Kubernetes
* Kubernetes is a system that helps you manage containers, which are packages of applications. It automatically deploys, scales, and repairs these containers on multiple computers, making sure your application stays available and runs smoothly in any environment.
## 2. Monolithic vs microservices  
### Monolithic
* A monolithic application is built as a single, unified codebase where all components are tightly connected and deployed as one unit. This makes it simpler to start with but harder to scale, update, or maintain as it grows. If one part fails, the whole application can be affected. In Kubernetes, a monolithic app is typically run as one or a few large containers, and scaling means replicating the entire app.
### Microservices
* Microservices architecture breaks an application into smaller, independent services, each handling a specific function and communicating via APIs. These services are deployed independently, allowing easier scaling, updates, and flexibility in technology choices. Kubernetes excels at managing microservices by running each service in its own container or pod, providing features like load balancing, scaling, and self-healing for each service independently.

| Aspect         | Monolithic            | Microservices                    |
|----------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Structure      | Single, unified app  | Multiple independent services   |
| Deployment     | One big container    | Many small containers/pods      |
| Scalability    | Scale whole app      | Scale individual services       |
| Maintenance   | Harder as it grows   | Easier with independent services|
| Technology    | One language/frameworks | Mix of languages per service    |
| Kubernetes Fit | Simpler, but less flexible | Ideal, supports distributed services |
